In this study we created digital soil maps of exchangeable calcium and magnesium using three main approches viz- Geostatistical (GS), statistical (SA) and Hybrid (HA). 

In case of GS approach we used software Vesper (1.62) from the University of Sydney. Details about this software installation and use can be found on (https://precision-agriculture.sydney.edu.au/resources/software/)

In case of SA and hybrid approach, we used Rstudio (3.6). Instruction about installing and use of Rstudio can be found at (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

In dveloping R codes, guidelines from following book were used:
Malone, B. P., Minasny, B., & McBratney, A. B. (2017). Using R for digital soil mapping. Basel, Switzerland: Springer International Publishing.
